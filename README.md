# TRAIN-Week-1-Projects
### This project contains the materials and sources needed for the OPTIONAL Week 1 of the Train PD Project!

##### Book2 and happiness_index are the two source files. Take a look at the material from both. We won't be directly using those two for our final parts of the project, but it is cool to see where the data came from! merged_data is what we will be using for most of this project and is the combined version of the two previous.
